            <p>Hi! My name is Noah Fedder, and this is a website I have created to showcase my passion projects.
                 I have experience with a wide variety of programming languages and systems. To list some of them:
                 SQL relational databases, C++, C, HTML, CSS, javascript, and python. The projects that you see
                 here are created 100% by me, just because I thought they would be cool. I will likely be adding
                 to this over time.</p>
